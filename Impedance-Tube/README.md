# Impedance Tube

**Type:** Experimental / Instrumentation  
**Tools:** LabVIEW, NI 4499 DAQ, MATLAB  

## 🔍 Overview
Designed and implemented a 4-microphone impedance tube setup for measuring **Sound Transmission Loss (STL)**.  
Integrated with NI DAQ and LabVIEW to record acoustic data and compute STL vs frequency curves.

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Configured NI 4499 DAQ channels for four microphones.  
- Developed LabVIEW VI for real-time acquisition and analysis.  
- Processed frequency-domain data in MATLAB for STL computation.
