Reference Study:
Nguyen et al., “Layered Metamaterial Beam Structures With Local Resonators for Vibration Attenuation.”

**🔬 Objective**

To design and analyze a multi-layered vibro-acoustic metamaterial using novel resonator configurations for low-frequency noise and vibration control.

**⚙️ Design Overview**

Geometry: Cylindrical metamaterial (Ø 100 mm × 50 mm thickness)

Structure: In-plane repeating J-shaped beams with local resonators

Configurations:

Metamaterial A:

  5 layers

  63 resonators

  Maximized beam length and cavity volume

Metamaterial B:

  7 layers

  189 resonators

  Maximized resonator count for increased coupling

**🧠 Simulation Setup**

Software: ANSYS Workbench 2023 R1

**Materials:**

PLA (solid structure)

Air (fluid domain)

Domain: Impedance tube with Fluid–Solid Interaction (FSI)

Analysis Type: Harmonic acoustic analysis for Sound Transmission Loss (STL)

**📈 Key Findings**

Metamaterial A exhibited two broad bandgaps between:

  190–410 Hz

  550–710 Hz

Minimum Transmissibility: −20 dB

Performance: Metamaterial A achieved higher STL and broader attenuation compared to Metamaterial B.

**🧾 Conclusion**

Metamaterial A demonstrated superior vibro-acoustic isolation characteristics and was selected for further comparison with the reference study by Nguyen et al.
